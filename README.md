# Hello_world

Hello!

I create my GitHub account and I'm following the GitHub "Hello World" guide ...

What I've learned:

Step 1. Create a Repository (We can simply commit changes on the master.)

Step 2. Create a Branch

Step 3. Make and commit changes on the Branch

Step 4. Open a Pull Request, comparing the Branch with the master

Step 5. Merge the Pull Request, then delete the Branch
